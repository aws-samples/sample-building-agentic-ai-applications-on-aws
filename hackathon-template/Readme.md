For the hackthon follow these steps :
1. Clone the repo.
2. Copy this folder.
3. Rename it to your use case.
4. Create your content within the folder.
5. Create a pull request


The folder has sub folders, but feel free to structure your code the way you like it. To be used as part of a workshop though, it will help if you guide the participants from a simple notebook and add more notebooks as you add complexity
