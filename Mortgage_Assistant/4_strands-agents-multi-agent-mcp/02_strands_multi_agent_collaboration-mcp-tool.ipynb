      "I apologize, there seems to be an issue connecting to the credit check tool to retrieve your credit score based on your customer ID 1111. As an AI assistant without direct access to real financial systems, I cannot actually look up your credit score. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I can provide some general information about credit scores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Credit scores range from 300-850 for FICO scores and 501-990 for VantageScore models. Higher scores indicate lower credit risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Factors that influence credit scores include payment history, amounts owed, length of credit history, new credit applications, and credit mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Checking your own credit reports and scores from the major bureaus (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion) does not negatively impact your credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Most lenders use credit scores as part of their criteria for approving loans and setting interest rates. Higher scores generally qualify for better rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "- You are entitled to receive free annual credit reports from each bureau at AnnualCreditReport.com to review for accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know if you need any other general mortgage or credit related guidance! I'd be happy to provide more details within the scope of what an AI can discuss.\n",
