    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lab we introduced the **LangGraph** framework, how to create agents and add memory to it. In this lab we will build on single agent and create multiple agents\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "1. Understand how to create and connect multiple agents using LangGraph\n",
    "2. Learn how to define agent roles and responsibilities\n",
    "3. Implement a multi-agent system that can handle account enquiries, process new applications and provide FAQ\n",
    "4. Demonstrate how inter agent communication and handover occurs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this notebook, ensure you have:\n",
    "- Familiarity with LangChain concepts (optional but helpful)\n",
    "- Basic understanding of Python and Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "- AWS account with access to Amazon Bedrock and SageMaker\n"
