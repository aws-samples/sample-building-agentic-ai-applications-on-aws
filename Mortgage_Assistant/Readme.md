## Overview
In this workshop you will learn how to build an Agentic AI powered mortgage assistant.  You will begin with a simple use case and then gradually add complexity. You will also learn about the  different frameworks and libraries that can be used to build the agent. Specifically at the end of the workshop you will learn how to
1. Build single and multi agent collaboration system using Amazon Bedrock agents.
2. Build an MCP server for credit check.
3. Build multi agent collaboration system with MCP support using [Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/latest/)
4. Build multi agent collaboration system with MCP support using [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph). This lab will also introduce the swarm architecture.

## Sample prompts:
At the end of the workshop, the mortgage assistant will be able to handle multiple queries, including:
- "How do I apply for a new mortgage?"
