    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "1. Understand how to create a single agent using LangGraph\n",
    "2. Learn how to define tools for retrieving mortgage information\n",
    "3. Implement the ReAct pattern for reasoning and action execution\n",
    "4. Build a simple conversational interface for mortgage assistance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this notebook, ensure you have:\n",
    "- Familiarity with LangChain concepts (optional but helpful)\n",
    "- Basic understanding of Python and Jupyter notebooks\n",

    "-  en edge is how you specify the nodes are connected and state is transitioned along the graph\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First step in creating a graph is to define the state which includes the graph's schema and reducer functions that handle state updates\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph has pre-built `MessageState` that can be imported directly. If you have complex schemas, you can define them accordingly. For this lab, we will use the pre-built State schema"
