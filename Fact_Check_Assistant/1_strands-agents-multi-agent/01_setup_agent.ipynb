    "\n",
    "For comprehensive misinformation detection, follow this multi-step approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Initial Analysis\n",
    "- Use **claim_detection_assistant** to segment content and identify potentially problematic statements\n",
    "- This provides a structured list of all claims that need verification\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Specialized Verification\n",
    "- For mathematical/statistical claims → Use **math_assistant**\n",
    "- For factual claims requiring evidence → Use **research_assistant**\n",
    "- For complex claims → Coordinate multiple agents as needed\n",

    "4. **Coordinate multiple agents** for comprehensive analysis\n",
